# CLI App for basic image processing

This is just an initial project written in Rust, learning as I go along.

## How to use:
- Clone the repo and place an image (preferably a .png image) within the folder.
- Type command cargo run --release within your terminal.
- Follow the prompts, or type 'help' to view the instructions.
- You need to specify an output file: The program will create the file for you within the folder.
- You can chain processes, when in doubt use the 'help' command to check the processes and what inputs  they need.
- Flow of commands:
    - [inputFile.png] [outputFile.png] [process1] [value1] [process2] [value2] [value3] ...
